## The Modules

### manageiq_provider module

The `manageiq_provider` module currently supports adding, updating and deleting OpenShift, Amazon EC2 and Hawkular Datawarehouse providers to manageiq.  
Example playbooks [add_openshift_provider.yml](add_openshift_provider.yml), [add_amazon_provider.yml](add_amazon_provider.yml) and [add_hawkular_datawarehouse_provider.yml](add_hawkular_datawarehouse_provider.yml) are provided.
To update an existing provider pass the changed values together with the required parameters. To delete a provider change `state=absent`.  
SSL verification for HTTPS requests between ManageIQ and the provider is enabled by default. To ignore pass `provider_verify_ssl: false`.
To use a self-signed certificate pass: `provider_ca_path: '/path/to/certfile'`.  
After addition or update, each endpoint authentication is validated, a process which can take up to 50 seconds before timeout.
If all authentications are valid the provider's inventory is refreshed.
